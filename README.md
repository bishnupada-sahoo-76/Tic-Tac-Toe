# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple and interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game interface consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. Players take turns selecting cells in the grid to mark with either an 'O' or an 'X'. The objective of the game is for a player to align three identical symbols (either 'O' or 'X') in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.
